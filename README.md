# Totally Balanced Fall Flying



> Elytras are unfair because they are based on **theft** and **exploitation** and is **undemocratic**.
>
> Elytra flying is based on theft because it is based entirely on the privatization of the End Cities and its resources.
>
> Since The End does not have a store where you can purchase End Cities, 100% of this privatization came by way of pillage and plunder. Like Mark Twain said, "There is not an acre of ground on the globe that is in possession of its rightful owner, or that has not been taken away from owner after owner, cycle after cycle, by force and bloodshed."
>
> Elytra flying makes society undemocratic. Democracy is a society where people have equal political power and equal freedom. Since your political power and freedom depends on the amount of movement you have, having a way to fly gives those with Elytra 50 to 150,000 times more political power and freedom than others. This inequality no longer makes society democratic.

> Just like we replaced monarchies, and its private ownership of government, with democracy so the means of law making are publicly owned and controlled for the equal benefit of everyone, we should replace Elytra flying, and its private ownership of transportation, with democracy so the means of transportation are publicly owned and controlled for the equal benefit of everyone.
